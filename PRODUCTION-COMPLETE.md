## 🚀 How to Deploy

### Quick Production Start
```bash
# 1. Initialize production environment
node scripts/init-production.js

# 2. Configure your environment
cp .env.production .env
# Edit .env with your MongoDB URI, secrets, etc.

# 3. Start production server
npm start

# 4. Monitor health
curl http://localhost:3000/health
```

### Advanced Deployment Options

#### Option 1: PM2 Process Manager (Recommended)
```bash
npm run pm2:start      # Start with PM2
npm run pm2:monitor    # Monitor processes
npm run pm2:logs       # View logs
```

#### Option 2: Docker Container
```bash
npm run docker:build  # Build image
npm run docker:run    # Run container
```

#### Option 3: Docker Compose (Full Stack)
```bash
npm run docker:compose  # Start all services
```

## 🔧 Configuration Required

### Environment Variables (`.env`)
- `MONGODB_URI` - Your MongoDB connection string
- `SESSION_SECRET` - Random 64-char secret (generated automatically)
- `JWT_SECRET` - Random 64-char secret (generated automatically)
- `PORT` - Application port (default: 3000)
